### CREATION PROCESS
  
We used [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Philgck/projects/13) to create a project board and populated it with user stories and added labels according to MoSCoW prioritisation.
All but one of the 'must have' user stories were completed with any other issues being carried over to the next sprint of the project development.

![Project Board](readme.docs/images/project_board.png)

Each user story had acceptance criteria added.The fulfillment of the criteria for each of these can be demonstrated by the presence of the features on the site (see below). The CRUD funtionality of the 'Event', 'Wish List' and 'Friends' models were tested extensively throughout each development phase both manually and through automated unit tests.

## DESIGN

### Typography

The website uses the following fonts:

- **Arial**: The primary font used throughout the website for its clean and professional appearance. Arial is a widely available sans-serif font that ensures readability and consistency across different devices and browsers.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme of the website is was taken from open source Bootswatch (https://bootswatch.com/quartz/) and we chose the Quartz theme which provides a fun and colourful background and a non-intrusive background that is easily viewed in both light and dark modes. This design was chosen as it had a fun and warm feel to associate with gift-giving occasions. 


### Imagery
- **Pixabay**: Royalty-free stock images that are used to complement the content. [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)

The 'Gifting Genie' icon is used as the icon to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the website. The same icon is included both on each page in the Navbar and as a recognisable icon as the favicon for the tab. [Procreate](https://procreate.com/)
![favicon and icon](readme.docs/images/icon_and_favicon.png)

### Layout and Styling

The website features a consistent layout and styling across all pages, ensuring a cohesive user experience. Key design elements include:

- **Header**: The header contains a collapsible navbar that is consistent across all pages. It includes links to the main sections of the website, pplanner, friendslist and user wishlists. The navbar also includes login and signup links for unauthenticated users and a logout button for authenticated users.
- **Collapsible Navbar**: The navbar is designed to be responsive and collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. This ensures that the navigation is accessible and user-friendly on all devices.
- **Footer**: The footer is consistent across all pages and includes links to social media apps Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and Pintrest. The styling is cohesive across all pages to give a cohesive look and feel across all pages.

### AI AUGMENTATION 

### Leveraging AI Tools for Code Creation
During the development of the Gifting Genie app, GitHub Copilot was utilized to assist in code creation. Copilot provided valuable code snippets and suggestions that accelerated the development process. Key areas where AI was used include:
- **Generating Views and Templates**: Copilot was instrumental in generating Django views and HTML templates. For instance, the initial structure of views such as `wishlist_view`, `add_event`, and `profile_view` were generated using Copilot. These snippets provided a solid foundation, which were then manually checked and modified to fit the project's specific requirements.
- **Form Handling**: Copilot assisted in creating forms for user input, such as `WishlistItemForm` and `PlannerForm`. The generated code snippets were reviewed and adjusted to ensure they met the application's validation and processing needs.
- **File and Directory Management**: Copilot was invaluable in reminding the developer of the numerous files and directories to amend when new models, views, or features were introduced, ensuring that all the correct files were updated.
While Copilot provided a significant boost in productivity, it was essential to manually review and modify the generated code to ensure accuracy and alignment with project requirements.

### AI-Assisted Debugging
GitHub Copilot played a crucial role in identifying and resolving bugs. Key interventions include:
- **Error Handling**: Copilot suggested error handling mechanisms for views and forms. For example, it provided initial code for handling form validation errors, which were then refined to improve user feedback and error reporting.
- **Debugging Views**: When encountering issues with view logic, Copilot suggested potential fixes and improvements. These suggestions were cross-referenced with the current code using tools like Diffchecker and W3S to ensure the changes were appropriate and did not introduce new issues.
Manual use of Diffchecker was crucial in comparing Copilot's suggestions with the existing codebase, ensuring that only the most relevant and accurate changes were implemented.

### Optimizing Code for Performance and User Experience
Copilot was also used to optimize code for performance and enhance user experience:
- **Efficient Query Handling**: Copilot suggested optimizations for database queries, such as using Django's `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to reduce the number of database hits and improve performance.
- **Responsive Design**: Copilot provided initial CSS and JavaScript snippets to enhance the application's responsiveness. These snippets were manually adjusted to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices using custom color choices and fonts, as well as Bootstrap and Flexbox for structure and positioning.

### Generating Django Unit Tests
Copilot assisted in generating Django unit tests to ensure code coverage for key functionalities:
- **Test Logic Generation**: Copilot generated initial test cases for views, forms, and models. For example, it provided test cases for creating, editing, and deleting wishlist items, as well as adding and removing friends. These tests were reviewed and adjusted to improve accuracy and completeness.
- **Ensuring Code Coverage**: Copilot's suggestions helped ensure all critical paths were tested. For instance, it generated tests for edge cases, such as handling invalid form submissions and testing user permissions. The generated test logic demonstrated a basic understanding of the application's functionality, and manual adjustments were made to ensure the tests accurately reflected the intended behavior.

### Additional AI Tools
In addition to GitHub Copilot, other AI tools were leveraged in much lesser forms:
- **Perplexity**: Used for generic questions regarding feature planning and implementation, providing valuable insights and information.
- **Microsoft Copilot**: Assisted in generating user stories and blog content based on key information provided by the developer

### Reflection on AI Tools
Using GitHub Copilot and other AI tools significantly enhanced the development process by providing relevant code snippets and suggestions. They accelerated the initial coding phase, assisted in debugging, and ensured comprehensive test coverage. However, it was essential to manually review and adjust the generated code to ensure it met the project's specific requirements and maintained high standards of quality and performance. Copilot can occasionally repeat itself despite clear prompts, as if it 'forgets' the previous steps or the focus of the initial query, which can be time-consuming. It is crucial to know when to manually take over reviewing the code.

## TESTING

I have used the W3C Markup validator to validate all of my HTML code - [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

Pages in this project are developed using DTL and all except the landing page (and login, logout and sign-up pages which are Django admin tools that I have no control over) require user authentication. The HTML validator will throw errors if I were to use the URL so I followed the below approach for the landing page and the templates:
  - navigate to the deployed Heroku link
  - right click to find the 'view page source' link
  - copy and paste the HTML code from here into the validator via the direct input

[home page html validation](readme.docs/...)
[A MODEL page html validation](readme.docs/...)

   ### CSS validation

[CSS validation](readme.docs/...)

[W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate the CSS file. External CSS for Bootstrap, provided by [CDN](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.2.3/css/bootstrap.min.css) was not tested.

   ### Javascript validation

  [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com) - the JavaScript validator was to be used - did not throw up and issues. 

   ### Python validation 
[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) will be used to validate the python code.



## Lighthouse scores from Heroku deployed app via Chrome dev tools 
![lighthouse](readme.docs/images/lighthouse_desktop.png)
![lighthouse](readme.docs/images/lighthouse_mobile.png)

We were delighted that our recent Lighthouse audit yielded excellent performance scores for the desktop version of our application. This achievement reflects the hard work and dedication of our development team in optimizing the user experience for desktop users. However, we also noted that the mobile performance scores were not up to our expectations. Recognizing the importance of a seamless mobile experience, we have prioritized addressing these issues in the upcoming sprint. Our team is committed to enhancing mobile performance to ensure that all users, regardless of their device, enjoy a fast and responsive application.



<br>

### Agile Process for Gifting-Genie

We adopted an agile methodology using a GitHub project board, applying MoSCoW prioritization to manage my tasks. The board was regularly updated to ensure all 'Must have' and 'Should have' features were addressed. Some 'Could have' issues remain in the backlog for future sprints, as detailed in the 'Future Features' section below.
